Growler Hour (work in progress)
An app to find and filter available beers nearby that are available for growler fills.

Open the growlers.xcworkspace file
You will need to have Cocoapods installed and run pod install before running the app.

Currently all of the retailers are in Portland, OR.  I am working on adding Seattle retailers as well.  The app will use your current location with location services but to test you can also input a custom location in the filter menu on the search page.

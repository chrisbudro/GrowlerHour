Growler Hour (work in progress)
An app to find and filter available beers nearby that are available for growler fills.

Open the GrowlerHour.xcworkspace file

Currently most of the retailers are in Portland, OR but I have added several Seattle retailers as well.  The app will use your current location with location services but to test you can also input a custom location in the filter menu on the search page.  For development, the app will default to Portland, OR when launched in the simulator.
